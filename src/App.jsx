          Born in 2003 in the south of France, my passion for programming began
          during my teenage years when I discovered I could make video games of

          beginning of a <b>great adventure</b>.

          Currently studying at <b>Dawan</b> in Toulouse in hopes of becoming a
          full stack developer.
